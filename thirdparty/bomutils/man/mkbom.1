.SH NAME
mkbom \- create a bill-of-materials file
.SH SYNOPSIS
mkbom [-i] [-u uid] [-g gid] source target\-bom\-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fImkbom\fR creates a bill-of-materials file specified by \fItarget-bom-file\fR from the contents of the directory
specified by \fIsource\fR. This bill-of-materials file can be used to create Mac OS X installer packages.
Alternatively, by specifying the \fB\-i\fR option, \fImkbom\fR can create a bill-of-materials file from a text file
specified by \fIsource\fR, which lists the contents of a directory in the format generated by \fIlsbom\fR
and \fIls4mkbom\fR. See the tutorial at http://hogliux.github.io/bomutils/tutorial.html
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
Treat \fIsource\fR as a file containing a list of files and folders in the format generated by \fIlsbom\fR and
\fIls4mkbom\fR.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
Each file or folder entry listed for a BOM contains the owner's user and group identifier (e.g. 500/501). Typically,
these Linux values are meaningless on the Mac platform. Use the \fB\-u\fR option to force the user identifier to a
specific value. Typically, this value should be 0 (i.e. root). This option cannot be used with the \fB\-i\fR
option, because in that case the user identifier is read from the source file list.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR
Similar to the \fB\-u\fR option but forces the group identifier to a specific value. Typically this value should be
80 (i.e. admin). This option cannot be used with the \fB\-i\fR option, because in that case the group identifier is
read from the source file list.

.SH BUGS
Long paths and some characters in filenames will cause mkbom to fail on Windows.
